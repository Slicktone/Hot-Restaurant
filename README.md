# Hot-Restaurant

A Super cool Node / Express based web application for handling reservation requests.

The application is made up of two parts:
- A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data.
- A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data.

The application used for reference can be found here:  http://hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com/
